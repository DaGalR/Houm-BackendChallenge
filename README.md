# Houm-BackendChallenge

This code contains the 3 functions required to answer the 3 corresponding questions. All code is written in Python 3.9.
The code is meant to be executed once, and by doing so, the 3 functions are called and
executed sequentially, as well as their results being stored in a separate auto-generated
file called "houm_challenge_log.log". This file contains the answers for each question 
with its desired format as specified in the instructions given. 

Also, the requirements.txt file is included into the project's folder. This is the same 
file to be sent to the corresponding e-mail addresses I was given.
